2)user defined variables

->declare inside script file as follows
a=10
b=20
echo"$a";
echo $(($a+$b)) or echo $((${a}+${b}))
----------------------------------------
echo enter a value
read a
echo enter b value
read b
c=`expr $a + $b`
echo the addition values is : $c
echo $((a+b))


->taking the parameter from the command line
a=$1
b=$2
sh filename.sh 10 15

eg:progarm1
-----------
#! /usr/bin/bash --
echo "hello"
x=$1
y=$2
echo $((${x}+${y}))
a=10
b=20
echo $(($a+$b))

eg:program2

#! /usr/bin/bash --
echo "enter your name"
read hi
