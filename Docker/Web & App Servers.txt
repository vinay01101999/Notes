Note 
=====
* Maven is designed & developed by using Java
* Tomcat is designed & developed by using java
* to access web service via browser ==> hit public ip in browser
* web service runs on http protocol which uses port 80
* to change default page of web service @ /var/www/html/index.html
* to access tomcat service => <public ip>:<port> & hit in browser
* tomcat runs on port 8080 (default port)
* when we access tomcat service, it looks for path /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/index.html
  but, when we install tomcat we get only /usr/share/tomcat/webapps
* create ROOT dir & create index.html page
