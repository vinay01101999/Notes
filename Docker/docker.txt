=>In previously we have one application one server,let's consider as it manage upto 1000 trafffic
=>when more traffic is increase the application will stop working so to solve this problem
VmWare is introduce virtualization

virtualization
==============
->In virtualization we are difining more OS and with respect to os we have more servers so if any traffic is increase
it will forward to next server



Disadvantages
=============
->cost
->maintenance
->scalability
->optimisation
->performance
->it does not run many applications with one os

->to solve this problem we are using docker container
