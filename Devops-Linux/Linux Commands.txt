=============================================
date  --> to display date of today's
cal   --> to display currrent month cal
cal <mon> <year> --> to display particular month & year
cal <year> --> to display all months from particular year
ifconfig --> to display n/w properties
hostname -i --> to display only ip address
hostname    --> to display hostname of instance
hostname -f -->  ""                ""

whoami --> in which user profile you are in
who    --> who logins into instance & from which ip address

We have 2 types of users
 - Admin / root user / Super user = #
 - Normal users = $

A User can be created in 2 ways
-> User Created by user -> > 1000 (user id)
-> User Created by script -> <= 1000

sudo su <user name> -> to change user
   sudo -> super user do
   su   -> Switch user
   sudo -i

user details are available @ /etc/passwd
Group details are available @ /etc/group

cat /etc/passwd  --> to list / display user details 
useradd <user name> --> to add / create user
userdel <user name> --> to remove user 
id <user name> --> to list particular user details

cat /etc/group --> to list group details
groupadd <group name> --> to add group
groupdel <group name> --> to remove group
groupmod -n <new name> <old name> --> to rename group

* When we create user, it creates user & group with same names. And that group
  will be primary group for that user
* For users we have 1 Primary groups & n Secondary groups (We can change)
* Every user will have home dir

usermod -g <new grp name> <User name> --> to change primary group for user 
usermod -G <grp name> <user name> -> to add/change Secondary group (limits to 1)
gpasswd -a <user name> <group name> --> add user to group
gpasswd -d <user name> <group name> --> remove user from group

files & dir
===========
touch <file name> --> will create file
touch <f1> <f2>   --> to create group for files with diff name
touch <file name prefix>{1..10}.txt --> to create mass of files with same prefix
vi <file name>    --> to create file & open file in editor
vim <file name>   --> to create file & open file in editor
After open file
    press "i" --> to enter into insert/write mode
            <write content>
    press "esc" --> to exit write mode
    :wq!  => writes content into file & closes editor
    :w!   => writes content inti file
    :q!   => Discards changes & closes editor
rm <file name> --> to remove file
rm -rf <file name> --> to remove forceful

mkdir <dir name> --> to create dir
mkdir <d n> <d n> --> to create more than 1 dir
mkdir <dir prefix>{1..10}
rmdir <dir name> --> to remove particular dir (empty dir)
rm rf <dir name> --> to remove non empty dir (forcefull remove)
mv <old name> <new name> --> to rename

ls - listing commands
----------------------
default list -> 0-9a-z in access

ls     -> lists files & dir in default order
ls -r  -> lists files & dir in reverse order (z-a9-0)
ls -s  -> lists files & dir with sizes in default order
ls -t  -> lists files & dir in temporal (last created first)
ls -a  -> lists all (normal file & system file) files & dir in default order 
ls -l  -> lists files & dir in long list format (complete details)
ls -ar
ls -arls

files which are started with "." -> system / hidden files
files which are NOT started with "." -> Normal files

======== Permissions ========
read  -> r -> 4          user/owner -> u    + -> grant
write -> w -> 2          group -> g         - -> revoke
execute -> x -> 1        others -> o        = -> reassign
no perm -> - -> 0

chmod {whom}{op}{perm} <file name> --> permission change
chmod u+x a.txt

chown <new owner> <file name> --> to change owner for file
chgrp <new group> <file name> --> to change group for file
chown <owner>:<group> <file name> --> to change owner & group for file

cd -> change dir
----------------
cd <dir name> --> to change from present to specified dir
cd <d n>/<d n>/<d n> --> to change to particular path
cd .. --> to change from present to its parent
cd /  --> to change from any dir to "/"
cd    --> to change from any dir to present user home dir
cd ~  -->   "           ""                    ""
cd -  --> to change to previous dir

head, tail, grep, cat, echo, cp, mv, paste
=====================================
head <file name> -> to list 1st 10 lines from file
head -n <number> <file name> -> to list given number of line from starting
tail <file name> -> to list last 10 lines from file
tail -n <number> <file name> -> to list given number of line from Last
head -n <number> <file name> | tail -n <ul - ll + 1> -> tl list specific range of lines

grep -e <search word> <file name> --> to search exact match
grep -e <s w> -e <s w> <file name> --> to search exact match
grep -e <search word> *.txt
grep -e <search word> ab*
grep -i <search word> <file name> --> case insensitive search
grep -v <search wprd> <file name> --> Non matched lines


>   -> first it checks for src file is available or not
       yes
         -> checks if dest file is available or not
            yes -> overwrite existing content with src file content
            no  -> creates dest file & copies content from src to dest file
       no -> throws error & stops


>>  -> first it checks for src file is available or not
       yes
         -> checks if dest file is available or not
            yes -> Src file content will be appended to dest file content
            no  -> creates dest file & copies content from src to dest file
       no -> throws error & stops

cp <src file> <dest file> --> to copy file
mv <src file> <dest file> -> to move file

cat <file name> --> to list content of file on console
cat <src file> > <dest file>
cat <src file> >> <dest file>

echo "<content>" > <file name>
echo "<content>" >> <file name> 

paste <file1> <file2> -> to display content from more than 1 file on console
paste <file1> <file2> > <file3>
paste <file1> <file2> >> <file3>

Compression & Extr
==================
zip -> 50%
gun zip -> 75%
bun zip -> 87.5%

tar -cf <o/p>.tar <file name> => Zip
tar -czf <o/p>.gz.tar <file name> => Gun Zip
tar -cjf <o/p>.bz2.tar <file name> => Bun Zip

tar -xf <o/p>.tar
tar -xzf <o/p>.gz.tar
tar -xjf <o/p>.bz2.tar
